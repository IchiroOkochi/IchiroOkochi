## About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student at Purdue University focused on building systems that combine artificial intelligence, engineering design, and real-world application.

My work spans:
- AI & multilingual systems
- Aerospace modeling and simulation
- Embedded and hardware-oriented thinking
- Backend systems and mobile applications

I am particularly interested in how intelligent systems interact with physical systems.
